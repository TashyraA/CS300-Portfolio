# CS300-Portfolio
## Portfolio Submission – Project Reflections

### What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

In the projects for this course, I focused on solving problems related to how data can be efficiently stored, accessed, and managed using appropriate data structures. For Project One, I analyzed the runtime and memory usage of different data structures to understand their performance trade-offs. For Project Two, I developed a program that allows users to load a file of courses, organize them using a binary search tree, and then print them in alphanumeric order or search for specific course information.

### How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.

I approached these problems by first understanding the requirements and then determining which data structures best matched the tasks. For example, I chose a binary search tree for Project Two because it naturally organizes data in a way that supports efficient insertion, search, and sorted traversal. Data structures are essential because they determine how data is organized in memory, which directly impacts the performance and scalability of a program.

### How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

There were a few challenges I had to work through, such as understanding how to properly parse and store multiple prerequisites for a course and how to handle file reading errors. I overcame these by carefully debugging my code, testing with multiple input scenarios, and referring back to course resources when needed. Breaking the problems into smaller steps also helped me stay organized and focused.

### How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

Working on these projects has helped me think more critically about design decisions before writing any code. I now start by thinking about what the data will look like, how it will be used, and which structure will make the program easier to write and maintain. I’ve also started planning my classes and functions more intentionally, which helps me write cleaner, more modular code.

### How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

Through this project, I’ve learned to write programs with maintainability in mind—using meaningful variable names, organizing functions into logical units, and including comments to make the code more understandable. I also better appreciate the importance of handling edge cases and errors gracefully so the program can adapt to unexpected input. These habits are helping me become a stronger, more professional developer.
